### More on the Sphere and the MeshDistory Material

This project utilizes react-three/drei and react-three/fiber. Docs can be found here: https://docs.pmnd.rs/drei

The AnimatedSphere component contains the the MeshDistortMaterial component and it's properties- you can change color, animation speed, amount of distort, etc from here!
